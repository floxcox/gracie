      <p>Grace Hopper (born December 9, 1906, New York, U.S.—died January 1, 1992, Arlington, Virginia).
      She was a American mathematician and rear admiral in the U.S. Navy who was a pioneer in developing computer technology,
      helping to devise UNIVAC I, the first commercial electronic computer,
      and naval applications for COBOL (common-business-oriented language).

      <p>Grace Hopper was an absolute mad lad. She studied math and physics at Vassar College.
      After graduating from Vassar in 1928, she proceeded to Yale University,
      where she received a master's degree in mathematics in 1930. That same year,
      she married Vincent Foster Hopper,
      becoming Grace Hopper (a name that she kept even after the couple's 1945 divorce, the crazy mofo she was).
      Starting in 1931, Hopper began teaching at Vassar while also continuing to study at Yale, where she earned a Ph.D.
      in mathematics in 1934—becoming one of the first few women to earn such a degree.

      <p>Hopper, who became an associate professor at Vassar,
      continued to teach until World War II compelled her to join the U.S. Naval Reserve in December 1943 (she opted for the Navy, as it had been her grandfather's branch of service).
      She was commissioned as a lieutenant in June 1944. Given her mathematical background,
      Hopper was assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard University, where she learned to program a Mark I computer. On September 9,
      1947, Harvard’s Mark II Aiken Relay computer was malfunctioning.
      After rooting through the massive machine to find the cause of the problem, Admiral Grace Hopper, who worked in the Navy’s engineering program at Harvard, found the bug.
      It was an actual insect. That is why we call flaws in the computer-world bugs!</p>
